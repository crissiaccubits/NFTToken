# Test NFT

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Make an ERC721 contract with a total supply of 999. Only 9 tokens can be minted at a time. NFT Minting price will be 0.001 ETH. The owner can withdraw funds from the smart contract. Make sure all validations are there in the smart contract. Deploy contract any testnet and integrate it in backend . On backend develop api for mint new tokens, and view already minted tokens of given wallet. All required validation should be present on back end. For Submitting the project please share GitHub public.
